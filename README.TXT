What is Job Market?


JobMarket is decentralized market that enables workers and employers 
to directly find each other without intermediaries or central authority.

JobMarket matches two parties using equilibrium outcome algorithms 
and helps them through the complete job life-cycle using smart contracts and Ethereum. 

We are pushing the definition of traditional job market here, 
since workers and employers could be anything that can attain access to Ethereum blockchain, 
including fridges, drones, or even automated factories.

It's a very simple dream powered by the inspiration that originally came from Mike Hearn:
